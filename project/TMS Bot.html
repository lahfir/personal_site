                      <p>
                        Trust My Stocks is a company that provides a
                        <b> signal sharing service </b> on Telegram for a
                        monthly subscription fee. The client approached me with
                        the need to automate the process of acquiring new
                        clients and managing them on an interactive dashboard. I
                        was tasked with developing a Telegram bot with
                        <b>
                          best coding practices and creating a CRM dashboard
                          using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JS.
                        </b>
                        The backend stack of the application was kept in Python,
                        allowing the client to communicate with their members
                        through the dashboard. Additionally, I integrated
                        <b> Stripe and Paypal </b> to collect payments.

                      <p>
                        The main goal of the project was to create an automated
                        system that would acquire new clients and manage them on
                        an interactive dashboard. The client wanted a seamless
                        user experience and a high conversion rate. The system
                        was expected to be bug-free and easy to use.

                      <p>
                        One of the main challenges of this project was to
                        integrate the Telegram bot with the CRM dashboard
                        seamlessly. The client also wanted to be able to
                        communicate with their members through the dashboard
                        itself. Another challenge was to ensure that the system
                        was secure and reliable.

                  <p>
                    To achieve the project goals, I employed a
                    <b> four-step process. </b><br /><br /><b>Firstly,</b> I
                    conducted thorough research on the signal sharing service
                    industry and identified the best coding practices for
                    creating a Telegram bot and a CRM dashboard.<br /><br /><b
                      >Secondly,</b
                    >
                    I created a prototype of the system and conducted multiple
                    rounds of testing and modification to ensure that it was
                    bug-free and easy to use.<br /><br /><b>Thirdly,</b> I
                    integrated Stripe and Paypal to collect payments, ensuring
                    that the payment process was secure and reliable.<br /><br />
                    <b>Finally,</b> I deployed the system and conducted
                    performance checks to ensure that it was running smoothly.

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                  The deployment of the automated system was a huge success.
                  Within the first two hours of deployment, the Telegram bot had
                  over <b>600 real-time conversations</b> with potential
                  clients. Out of those, 323 people signed up for a monthly
                  subscription, resulting in a <b>53% conversion rate.</b> The
                  CRM dashboard was user-friendly and provided an intuitive user
                  experience, which contributed to the
                  <b>high conversion rate.</b> The integration of Stripe and
                  Paypal was successful, and the payment process was secure and
                  reliable.
